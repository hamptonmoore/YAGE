## Purpose?

I have always liked the idea of making an iO so I decided I would start giving it a shot.

## The Plans?

A basic nodejs backend server which pipes data to a frontend client. This client can be hosted on a static web hosting service like github pages, while the backend can be deployed to a place like heroku.
